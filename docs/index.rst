Welcome to eth.events's documentation!
======================================

Constructing a query and understanding what an eth.events server returns to it 
is the most important skill you need in order to get started with eth.events.

If you are new to Elasticsearch and eth.events, you first should:

- Read our :doc:`developer tutorial </tutorials/query>`
- Familiarise yourself with the `Elasticsearch Query DSL <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl.html>`__.
- Understand the schema and how events are :doc:`mapped </endpoints/index>`

.. TODO implement when accesible:
.. - Use the open API endpoint at api.eth.events to test your queries

- Build a simple :doc:`web app </tutorials/block-explorer>` querying and displaying the results
